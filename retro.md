Retro History

3/16/21 - Ethan & Joel
Improve
- Agenda Timer not working right - slow? (https://www.timeblocks.co/)
- DONE: VS Code add-in(s) to make more like full IDE with better refactoring tools, etc.
- Add project setup instructions
- Discuss more how to write 1st test together in newly set up project
Liked
- We got a new class implemented in js together! (red green refactor commit push!)
- Agenda timer (https://www.timeblocks.co/)
- Successfully set up calendar project on Joel's PC 
- Used mob timer even though Ethan had to navigate mostly (only one who knew)


RETRO IMPROVEMENTS:
- 3/11/2021:
  - (Some discussion of how to get up and running faster with new JavaScript project; ultimately decided 
    to just use Ethan's existing calendar js project to do our SimpleCar js sample code next time)
- 3/4/2021:
  - Time how much time we're coding & try to increase
  - Later: ideas - modify mob timer to add TTS ("stand" reminder, etc.)
- 2/25/2021
  - Stand every rotation (optionally stand while navigating) 
    (Help manage energy level in meeting)
  - Figure out how Ethan can right-click remotely
  - Ethan: Turn off Slack

- 2/18/2021:
  - Try retros every 30 min (timer loops every 35 min) - even if not coding
  - Ethan have snack and water on hand before meeting
  - Start the project within 5 minutes of session start time. 
      - Prefer to start with a coding task and get through red-green-refactor (full cycle)
      - Arrange times to talk about outside projects, etc. (e.g., Reach for Help)

GOOD / keep doing: 
- 3/11/2021:
  - Started project quickly
  - Used cyber-dojo for sample js test code
  - Set up 3 named timers before meeting (break, retro, wrap-up)
  - Doing setup in which only one person knew what to do, we still switched off but knowledgable driver just said aloud what doing
  - Set within-retro timer for 5 min.
- 3/4/2021:
  - standing (and adding "stand" to the mob timer for navigator)
  - finished Java car project and set up start of JavaScript project, and consolidated into single repository
  - snacks
- 2/25/2021:
    - Snack
    - Notes for what to do at start of meeting
    - Mob timer & switching every 5 min. 
- 2/18/2021:
    - Not using Zoom remote control
    - Using GitHub and typing on own computer
    - AnyDesk (Ethan likes it)
    - Alt-drag mouse works to select vertically in a file
    - Rotate on green (after red-green or after refactor-commit) (mob timer 5 min. as backup max. time)
    - Using google for syntax and taking the simplest one
- 2/4/2021:
    - Added TDD pre-step: Determine the simplest requirement to move forward
    - Got tests done; did TDD (all steps), took turns
    - Discussed expectations in beginning
    - Expected complexity
