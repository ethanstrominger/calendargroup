# calendargroup
VO - Combine multiple meetup and other Webcal calendars into one calendar so that all the selected calendars can be subscribed to with one URL.

V1 - The calendar aggregator will facilitate sharing related events from Meetup, EventBrite, and calendars that use webcal via a 
calendar that event goers can subscribe to.  

V2 - Event goers will also be able to query based on criteria like 
date range, day of the week, start time, tags, and length and create custom calendars based on these criteria.  

V3 - Event goers will be able to subscribe to changes for an event automatically, by choice, or by selection.
