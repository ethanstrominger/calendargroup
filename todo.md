TO DO:  
- WIP: Test given valid ics formatted text, you can derive the timezone and event objects.    
  - We have a passing test, but need to add ics text and parse it:
  - Generate ICS text using ical generator
- Try Autoformat feature in Excel on CSV     
- Refactor SmartEventSource.getByUuid test and production
- Modify mob timer source code to add "stand" reminder (1) text, (2) text to speech (TTS) 
  [and consider other improvements]
- Add license
- (Joel) Try opening this project in Visual Studio (may require something different)     

DONE:
- Algorithm - Event fields to take/keep, etc.
