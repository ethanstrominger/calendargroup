TO DO:        
- When you create an event aggregator with name, then you get back name and UUID
- When you add two event sources to an aggregator, then you can get those event sources from the aggregator's event source list
- Time how much time we're coding & try to increase
- Modify mob timer source code to add "stand" reminder (1) text, (2) text to speech (TTS) 
  [and consider other improvements]
- Add license
- (Joel) Try opening this project in Visual Studio (may require something different)
